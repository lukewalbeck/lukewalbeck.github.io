## Portfolio Website

The following project is created using React, Axios, and Bootstrap in order to generate a front-end for my portfolio website. 

Utilizing a back-end Django REST Framework API that [I am also currently working on](https://github.com/lukewalbeck/RESTaurant-api), I'm using the [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) library in order to request the data and using React with Bootstrap to display the requested data. 

While still a work in progress, I do try to have the most up-to-date version hosted on github pages to [view here](https://lukewalbeck.github.io/)!
